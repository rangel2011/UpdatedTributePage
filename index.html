The weather was a lovely day that ranged from 55 to 65 degrees F. The photo below shows one of her favorite seasons because of the layers that she can wear.">

That year was also when Google.com was registered as a domain name. Another fun fact is that the average cost of a new home was $176,000 in America. That can now get you a nice small something something in today's money. Southern California has mostly clear and sunny skies year-round.">

Her school is a California Distinguished School, a National Blue Ribbon School, and a New American High School(this means she went to an intelligent school, y'all. We can trust her.). Once again, we can see the SoCal weather within this one photo. We have beautiful beaches here in Southern California that you can visit year-round because even on the colder days, a jacket and long sleeve shirt are enough to get you out to the shores.">

Like many, during COVID-19, she was getting educated and in the last year of her program. Although she did not get to walk across the stage for this degree, she again decided to take her education one step further. One of her favorite things to do in between juggling everything is finding new places to eat. You can always pair a delicious lunch or dinner meal with a great drink, too, for how demanding the workload is of the medical field.">

It will be a journey for her out in the sunny islands. Also, she better finish because this took a lot of time to learn and make for her—free work from me people. Then again, I am a millennial and teacher, so what don't I do for free already? LOL. Honestly, this was just a cute picture to use. If anything, it can signify who knows the road ahead, and even though the weather is fall, that is also a time of the year when things hibernate before emerging ready to take the world on in the next season. Who knows what the road ahead is for either of us, but I am sure that when the 'seasons' change, both of us will be ready.">
